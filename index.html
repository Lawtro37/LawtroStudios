        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Lawton Kelly but you can call me Lawtro
        </p>
        <p>
            I am an young, enthusiastic and aspiring programmer with a strong passion for coding. I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to bring value to this world.
        </p>
        <h2>Professional Interests</h2>
        <p>
            My passion for coding and programming has been a huge part of my life. I have been coding since a young age and want to make it a part of my career. I have experience developing small games and websites for school projects and just for fun. I also have been granted mentorships for my coding course.
        </p>
        <!--<h2>Project Experience</h2>
        <p>
            One of my notable projects is "Solar View," which I developed for a former primary school to teach students about the solar system. You can view it at <a href="www.lawtrostudios.com/solar-view">www.lawtrostudios.com/solar-view</a>.
        </p>-->
        <h2>Mentorships</h2>
        <p>
            I was fortunate enough to receive two mentorships, one of which involved creating a web game.
        </p>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p id="projects">
            I am excited about the opportunity to further develop my coding skills and contribute to innovative projects. My dedication to coding and passion for innovation drive me to excel in this field.

           <h1>Solar View</h1>
             <h2>An educational solar sim programmed using p5.js</h2>
               <p>
                   "Solar View" is one of my notable projects, and it holds a special place in my heart. I developed this educational solar simulator using the versatile p5.js library. The main goal behind this project was to make learning about the solar system an engaging and interactive experience for students. <br/><br/>
        
                  Solar View allows users to explore and interact with a virtual representation of our solar system. You can learn about the planets, their orbits, and other celestial objects in a fun and immersive way. The project was initially created for a former primary school, where it received a positive response from both students and educators. <br/><br/>
        
                To explore "Solar View" and embark on a journey through the cosmos, simply follow this [link](./solar-view) or watch the video below. It's an excellent resource for students, teachers, and anyone curious about our celestial neighborhood. <br/><br/>

                <h1>Custom Built 3D Renderer</h1>
                <h2>A custom 3D renderer for JavaScript</h2>
                <p>
                    I created a custom 3D renderer for JavaScript that allows for the creation of custom models using JSON files. This renderer provides the capability to toggle outlines and change the size of the shape. I am currently working on expanding its functionality to support multiple shapes and possibly developing a library with dynamic camera features and enhanced scripting capabilities. <br/> <br/>
            
                    This project has been an exciting journey into the world of 3D graphics, where I've gained insights into the inner workings of rendering engines and learned to optimize performance for complex models. The renderer is built using modern web technologies, making it accessible for a wide range of applications. <br/> <br/>
            
                    I look forward to further enhancing this project and exploring the possibilities of interactive 3D experiences on the web. Stay tuned for updates and additional features as I continue to push the boundaries of what can be achieved with JavaScript and 3D rendering. <br/> <br/>

                <h1>Cellular AI</h1>
                <h2>A Genetic Cellular AI</h2>
                <p>
                    "Cellular" is an exciting project that combines cellular particals with genetic AI techniques. It's designed to simulate complex cellular life, and I'm currently working on evolving it into a powerful and flexible tool for simulatig cellular AI. <br/> <br/> 

                    The project is inspired by the fascinating dynamics of cells and the adaptability of genetic algorithms. Cellular will provide a versatile framework to study patterns and behaviors in various fields, from biology to physics and beyond. Genetic algorithms, on the other hand, allow for the optimization and evolution of these cells to survive for as long as posible. <br/> <br/> 

                    In "Cellular," I've combined these concepts to create a platform where cellular structures can evolve and adapt to changing environments. This project has the potential for a wide range of applications, including the study of emergent behavior in complex systems, the optimization of cellular structures for specific tasks, and the exploration of creative and artistic possibilities. <br/> <br/>
