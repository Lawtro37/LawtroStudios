                    my coing Journey started with scratch, 
                    a block based coding website were you can code small 2D games. 
                    I made small games like cookie clicker and a runner game. 
                    Imedietly I grew a pasion for coding, 
                    I loved making games in scratch
                    but there scratch has many limitations 
                    so I began coding withMicrosoft Make Code Arcade.

                    block based coding website were 
                    you can code small 2D games. I spent half a 
                    year making this one game called "Robot Tag".
                    All of my friends loved my game even though it was 
                    quite simple. eventualy the game got so big the editer
                    started laging, thats when I new I needed to use text base 
                    coding.
